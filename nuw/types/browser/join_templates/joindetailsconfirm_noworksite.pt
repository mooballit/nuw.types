Hi,

A new member application has been completed by <tal:name tal:replace="options/name" /> with Employment Type <tal:employmenttype tal:replace="options/employmenttype" />.
They have no existing worksite (and if applicable, no agency), no payment has been collected, and so this application needs to be finalised offline.
<tal:whennamed tal:condition="options/other_worksite">
    The applicant has entered their own worksite name: <tal:worksitename tal:replace="options/other_worksite" />
</tal:whennamed>
<tal:whennamed tal:condition="options/other_agency">
    The applicant has entered their own agency name: <tal:worksitename tal:replace="options/other_agency" />
</tal:whennamed>

Name: <tal:name tal:replace="options/name" />
Email: <tal:email tal:replace="options/email" />
Phone: <tal:phone tal:replace="options/phone" />
Mobile: <tal:mobile tal:replace="options/mobile" />
